# Virtual-Screenshot-sharing
# 🖥️ Virtual Screenshot Sharing

A mini-project built by **Team Technical** that enables **real-time virtual screen sharing** between two systems using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Socket Programming**.
It’s lightweight, fast, and requires no third-party software — just Python!

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project captures screenshots from the sender’s screen in real-time and streams them to a receiver device over a network.
It uses socket programming for data transmission and OpenCV for frame display, creating a live virtual screen-sharing experience.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* 🐍 Python 3.10+
* 🎥 OpenCV
* 📡 Socket Programming
* 🧮 NumPy
* 🖼️ Pillow

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time screen sharing
✅ Simple sender–receiver connection
✅ Fast and lightweight performance
✅ Works over LAN/Wi-Fi
✅ Easy to set up and customize

## 🧩 Requirements

Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 🖥️ On Sender Side:

```bash
python sender.py
```

This will start the server and display your local IP address.

### 💻 On Receiver Side:

```bash
python receiver.py
```

Enter the **Sender’s IP address** when prompted.
Both systems must be connected to the same **Wi-Fi network**.
